-  There is currently no garbage collector

-  The || (or) and && (and) operators, when used whith non-functions types, 
will only compute one operand if possible: when ORing two things, if the
first one is False there is no need to compute the second one. On the
other hand when used with functions, BOTH operands are computed (executed
even, as they are functions)

-  In for-in-range statements, the first bound is always included but the
second one is only if the step is negative (the loop decrements):
for(int i : 0..5) will run for 0,1,2,3,4
for(int i : 5..-1..0) wil run for 5,4,3,2,1,0
